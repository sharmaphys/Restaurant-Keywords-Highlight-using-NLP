This capstone project uses natural language processing (NLP) with VADER and PyABSA. The main objective is
to extract the aspect based sentiment of customer reviews of restaurants on Nashville on Yelp online business directory.

For instance: "Food is awesome and the menus are great. But the wait time is crazy". In this review, the overall sentiment is positive.
However, the sentiment towards wait time is negative. Getting the sentiment of the review as a whole cannot capture this negative
sentimen towards the "wait time". 

This sort of information on aspects within a review will help customer to quickly obtain the positive and negative aspects of the restaurant and also the business owner to focus on improving towards the frequently mentioned negative factors of their restaurant.
